            - If coordinate has been already hit, try another until not hit
          - ADVANCED AI
            - If there is a hit, computer tries adjacent tiles
            - If there is a second hit, and a "direction" is defined, computer continues line on one side.
            - If no hit on that side, computer tries other side
